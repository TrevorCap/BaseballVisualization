# MLB Player Origins


## Mission: 
We are looking at baseball players ranging over the entire history of the MLB thanks to the wonderful [dataset](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/). Our reasoning for using this dataset is to see if there are any trends that occur. The results allow us to visually demonstrate both the concentration and the spread of baseball as a global sport over time. The results also demonstrate if there are locales which lend themselves well to the production of major league baseball players.
