## Topic: 
We are looking at baseball players ranging over the history of the MLB. We want to create a map showing where players are born, whether they were a hall-of-famer, the year they were born as well as the year and location they passed away. Our reasoning for this research is to see if there are any trends that occur.

This project will allow us to visually demonstrate both the concentration and the spread of baseball as a global sport over time. It will also demonstrate if there are locales which lend themselves well to the production of major league baseball players.
