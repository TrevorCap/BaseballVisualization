## Topic: 
We are looking at baseball players ranging over the history of the MLB. We want to create a map showing where and when players are born as well as the year and location they passed away. Our reasoning for this project is to see if there are any trends that occur.

This project will allow us to visually demonstrate the global reach of baseball. It will also demonstrate if there are locales which lend themselves well to the production of major league baseball players.

Additionally, we want to visualize the change in size of players over time.

This will be accomplished using d3, as well as leaflet, deployed through a Flask app with data held in SQL.
